    <p>
      Market research is indispensable for opening a new restaurant. From the data collected from Openrice, we can have general ideas about the size of the restaurant industry, customer preference, potential competitors and their reputations.</p>

    <p>There are around 230 restaurants in Ma On Shan. They provide more than 19 types of cuisines, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sichuan, Italian and Japanese food. </p>
      
    <p><b>The Top 10 restaurants receiving the highest comments, like and dislike are shown as follow.</b></p>
    
  <div class="table">
    <img src="a2_top 10 comments.png" alt="Top 10 in receiving comments">
    <p><i style="color:#898989">Top 10 restaurants in receiving comments</i></p>
    <img src="a2_top 10 like.png" alt="Top 10 in receiving like">
    <p><i style="color:#898989">Top 10 restaurants in receiving like</i></p>
    <img src="a2_top 10 dislike.png" alt="Top 10 in receiving dislike">
    <p><i style="color:#898989">Top 10 restaurants in receiving dislike</i></p>
  </div>
      
    <p>It seems that there are some overlaps in the restaurants receiving the highest comments, like and dislike. The table below justifies the hypothesis. It may be explained by their popularity increasing the possibility for people to share their opinions on food and the chances for them to be underserved.</p>
    <div class="table">
      <img src="a2_overlaps in top 10.png" alt="Overlaps in Top 10">
      <p><i style="color:#898989">Overlaps in Top 10 restaurants receiving comments, like and dislike</i></p>

    <p><b>What kinds of restaurants to choose if I were to have my own business in Ma On Shan?</b> The table below shows the number of different types of canteens under different price ranges.</p>
    
    <div class="table">
    <img src="a2_food type sorted by prices.png" style="width:400px" alt="Food type sorted by prices">
    <p><i style="color:#898989">Restaurants under different price ranges</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>It suggests that residents of Ma On Shan prefer light taste food, as they have Hong Kong-styled canteens most, followed by Japanese, Western and Cantonese-styled ones.People mainly spend on restaurants with prices below 50 HKD, and prices between 51 and 100 HKD.</p>
      
    <p>Therefore, considering the market demand, consumer spending power, and my individual financial capital, a good choice is to open <b>a restaurant offering light meals with prices below 100 HKD</b>. Alos,<b>Teochew cuisine</b> may be a better choice. Not because it caters to their eating habits, but also there are two Teochew restaurants falling in the 201-400 HDK range, meaning that people are willing to spend a high amount of money on Teochew food.</p>
